This is a short program that returns the number of times the letter 'b' appears in the sent text over a UDP connection.

- In server.py a UDP server socket is initialized on port 12000 of localhost and waits for incoming connections.
- A while loop is used (while server.py is running) to wait for messages from incoming client connections.
- Then the client message is modified to count 'b' and returns the number to the client.


- In client.py UDP client socket is initialized and binds to the server through port 12000.
- The user is prompted to enter a message to send to the server.
- The server sends back a message to the client that is injected into a print statement.
- Finally the client socket is closed.

* To run first have server script running, then open a different process to run the different number of clients
